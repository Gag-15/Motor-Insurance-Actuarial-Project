# Motor-Insurance-Actuarial-Project
This project aims to explore correlation between different variables, fit models and test assumptions based on the coursework of CS1 (Actuarial Statistics) examination. The project is made using RStudios and the data is taken from data.mendeley.com.
> Status: IN PROGRESS (analysis and modelling underway)

## Project Objectives
- To identify the correlation between different motor insurance variables
- Create a GLM with premium amount as the response variable
- Create a GLM with number of claims as the response variable
- To test certain assumptions and distributions on the data
- Summarize key takeaways and business relevant recommendations
